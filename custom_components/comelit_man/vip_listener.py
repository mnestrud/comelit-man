"""VIP event listener — monitors a persistent CTPP channel for doorbell and call events.

The Comelit app's PUSH channel is one-shot (FCM token registration, then close).
Actual call events (doorbell ring = CALL_FSM_STATUS_CHANGE / IN_ALERTING) arrive as
binary VIP messages on the CTPP channel. This module opens a CTPP channel with the
apartment's VIP address on the persistent TCP connection and watches for incoming events.

Binary CTPP message format:
  [prefix LE16] [timestamp LE32] [action BE16] [flags/param BE16]
  [extra bytes] [0xFFFFFFFF] [caller\0] [callee\0\0]

Known prefixes (from PCAP analysis):
  0x18C0 = call init (client → server)
  0x1800 = ACK / response
  0x1820 = confirm ACK
  0x1840 = event/notification (server → client, during call)
  0x1860 = VIP event (server → client, call setup / FSM change)
